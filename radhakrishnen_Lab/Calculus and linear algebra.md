# Calculus

Gradient - scalar function to vector field
Divergence - vector field to scalar function
- akin to a dot product so it's testing how in line two vectors are
Curl - vector field to vector field
- akin to a cross product so how perpendicular two vectors are
Laplacian<sup>2</sup> - scalar function to scalar funciton

# Linear Algebra



[Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) - a geometric object that has length (magnitude) and direction.
- Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) - wikipedia
- Cartesian space vector's need their start and end points defined in coordinate space
- In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of [basis vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_vector)

[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) - In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **matrix** (pl.: **matrices**) is a [rectangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle "Rectangle") array or table of [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number"), [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(formal) "Symbol (formal)"), or [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)"), with elements or entries arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a [mathematical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") or property of such an object.
- Matrices and matrix multiplication reveal their essential features when related to _linear transformations_, also known as linear maps
