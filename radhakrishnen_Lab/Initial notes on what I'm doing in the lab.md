>[!Summary]
> - I'll be working with the membrane side of the the grant proposal
> - There haven't been a lot of people working on it, so a workflow for easier use needs to be implemented
> - Read the two papers written by undergraduates and the review by Mala
> 	- Get a grasp on the theory and then start working on the membrane simulation that Mala did

#### Where the lab is right now
AMPs
- bacterial membranes are harder to model
- The grant lists 5 peptides
	- BFZ
	- DeslHDAP
	- Piscidin-3
	- Piscidin-1
	- lassiohlossin 2or3
- All five of these peptides have evidence of DNA interactions
	- BFZ and DeslHDAP especially
		- These two translocate rather than permeabilize
		- These both bind to DNA
	- The other three are shown to permeabilizing the cell and DNA interactions
- Basically they want to cross reference the DNA and Membrane binding affinity to see if there is any correlation to the AMP activity
- The paper I was given works with DNA mutants and binding affinity and ashley's work is continuing that
	- Might be good to work with osprey software
- The DeslHDAP is a work in progress
	- They do this in a five step workflow
		- WT simulations
		- charge opt
		- mutant simulations
		- calculate delta G
		- Experimental test
- My work will be on the membrane half of these five steps and trying to spend a lot of time on the methods section
	- Read the thesis of the two students who kinda worked on this stuff
	- Try to create a good workflow for the membrane permeability
	- Implementing my ideas and 
	- First thing on the project should be to redo the experiment that mala did with the 4 AMPs on the membrane
	- The workflow part is to basically set up scripts that keep a good workflow
