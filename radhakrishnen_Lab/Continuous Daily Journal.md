# Overview

This is going to be my daily lab notebook rather than the daily notes. I feel like this will be a lot easier as everything will be in one file and I can just keep it open to continuously edit it and link to other notes.

At this starting point the redo of Amy's simulation is almost done alongside the analysis of Mala's simulations (we're still working through the pdb issue as it stands), I've just begun starting to work with partial charge optimization of the ponatanib system and we've considered how to begin snapshot extraction of Mala's simulation.

## Monday - 09/16/2024 - ACS Abstract/

Started the day by review the ACS abstract and implementing some changes to it.
