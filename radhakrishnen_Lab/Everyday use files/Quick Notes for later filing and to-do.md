- We need to use the grid shrinking to calculate the potential (V, J/C) at every point of interest in the simulation.
> "The PBE and/or the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation can be solved numerically using well-established finite difference [93–95], boundary element [96–98], or finite element [99–101] techniques (reviewed elsewhere [102, 103]). Its solution provides the potential at desired locations."

>"Specifically, when the linearized PoissonBoltzmann equation (LPBE) is solved, linearity can be exploited such that one obtains, through superposition, the total electrostatic energy of the system by summing over the product of potentials and charges qi at each location"

>"The overall factor of 1/ 2 results from two different reasons [104]. First, it prevents double counting energetic contributions resulting from a charge feeling the potential generated by another charge (which, by reciprocity, is equal for a pair of interacting charges). Second, it accounts for the fact that the cost of generating a reaction field in response to a given charge is one-half of the resulting interaction energy with that charge [42]. Because this cost is in part an entropic contribution of reorienting solvent, the resulting energy in Eq. 6 is a free energy."

>"The method relies on the linear response assumption above, such that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the solvent reaction field potential generated by a charge is directly proportional to the charge’s magnitude</mark>. As a result, the solvation energy of a single charge qi is quadratic in the charge magnitude"
