## Step 1

* Things needed to comprehensively write the methods
	- In the redo of Amy's simulation there's an oddity with the lys 21 structure. It looks as if the oxygens are overlaid on top of each other and then goes to a normal structure post minimization.
	- Need to replicate/or understand how Amy superimposed the BF2 peptides overtop of the DesHDAP peptide and then how she translated them across the membrane
