I've really been doing bad about keeping a daily research notebook. 
For the past two days I've been woking on automating the charge optimization scripts and this included:
- The script to change the charges on the drug to 1
- The script to create the directories, individual directories for each atom edited.
	- This script also edited the run file to specify which atom it is performing the charge optimization calculation with
	- Copying all the important files into the directories
- The submit script to submit all the files
```
# use subfast_cp_ppn2 to submit jobs that use about 1gb of ram and build huge temp files
##this should really only be used for partial charge optimization or requiring solvers.
#ppn2 is to help allocate more ram to the job so it's not a limitiing facotr in the calculations
# cp is to prevent the network connection between iron and magnesium from being the limiting factor. The reason it would be the limiting factor is due to the fact that charge optimization matrix's make a lot of large temp files that have to be transferred back and forth unles the cp flag is used.
# to find infor on these /usr/bin/subfast
#which command can help you find paths ex. $which subfast
```
