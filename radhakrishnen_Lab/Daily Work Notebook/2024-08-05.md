Haven't written in here in a bit but I need to start getting into it again.
- I've written convergence scripts to automate the process for me and did it all the way up to the results (yippee)
- Now I'm starting to go to the charge optimization videos

Charge optimization video
 - Desolvation is quadratic due to the charge dependence of two molecules. If we have a plus two charge we know the reaction field will respond with a -2 charge (up till about -10 then it levels off) an so we know the coulombic interaction is quadratic up to that point
	 - Due to linear response? I think this is the 
 - the interaction charge is linear
	 - In the equation the a and b are proportionality constants. charge 2 experiences far lower desolvation penalties as its not on the interface. This lowers the value of b. As a result of this there can be a linear indirect interaction between charge 1 and the reaction field of charge 2 that has a linear relationship. ![[Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 9.33.07 AM.png]]

	 - There is some more here in the tutorials. I should go over the theory again just to make sure I have it
