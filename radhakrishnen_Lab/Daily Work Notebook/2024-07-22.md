First day of work:
- Ate at the biochem breakfast and talked to Mala and Don at 9 am
- Got through the I-9 form stuff
- took a lunch break for about a half hour with Katie and sky
- Talked with Mala about the project and where I'll fit into it

After talking to Mala I started to create this lab notebook. It's going to take a lot of work but I think it'll be a really good project to keep up

After setting up the notebook I'll get started on really diving into the tutorials and reading the papers
	start with home than move to research on iron for the tutorials
