had a rough day today coding, it did not go very well.
- Yesterday I finished up the charge optimization submission scripts and today I finished the script that creates the L matrix and the Cqr vector
Today
- Today I created the ql and cqr vectors and the L matrix using the scripts in the charge optimization folder.

### Matlab
- to analyze using matlab we use the following code to start up the program
	- /programs/bin/matlab -nojvm
		- -nojvm is a no java flag so that we don't see any graphics
- Next, to load in files we type
	- filename = load('file')
		- you can then do a command like size(L) for the size
		- L(1,2) to give you the first row second coulmn
		- to know how symmetric it is you can do L - L'
		- to know the biggest value from the symmetry command you can do max(max(abs(L - L'))) to tell us the most different values
		- you can find eigen values of the L matrix using eig(L)
- what we need to do is load in the ql vector, the Lmatrix, and the Cqr vector to check the L_matrix and calculate the int energies
	-  we just do LDP = q_actual'\*L\*q_actual
	- and INT = q_actual'\*Cqr
- we then know the optimal charge charge distribution must be ( I forgot why this is I need to go back and watch the video again)
	- q_opt = -0.5\*inv(L)\*Cqr
- You can then calculate the optimal binding free energy by doing the optimal LDP + optimal INT with this equation. We don't need the optimal receptor free energy as it's a constant
	- q_opt'\*L\*q_opt + q_opt'\*Cqr
	- this is added to the constant receptor desolvation penalty in the original table and that gives us the optimal binding free energy
