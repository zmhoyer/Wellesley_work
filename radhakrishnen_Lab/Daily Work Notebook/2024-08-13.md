## What I Learned? Techniques on how I did it

The initial equation is a little hard to understand but it appears to be saying the divergence of the vector field, the electric displacement field (C\*m<sup>-2</sup>), is equal to the scalar free charge density which has the units of C\*m<sup>-3</sup>

This equation can the allow us to say that the vector field of electric displacement is equal to the permittivity of the medium multiplied by the vector electric field (V\*m)

In electrostatics, we assume that there is no magnetic field (the argument that follows also holds in the presence of a constant magnetic field).


 This following equation is essentially saying that the electric field (V\*m) is equal to the negative gradient of the electric potential (since phi is the electric potential (V) taking the derivative with respect to distance gives us the electric vector field)

The minus sign is introduced so that we can find the minima of the gradient vector field rather than the maxima since the gradient operator finds maxima inherently. I think this is right but you know, idk

This leads to the derivation

where we get the laplacian (the divergence of the gradient) is equal to the negative scalar field of the charge density divided by the permittivity of the field


To actually solve this is a different matter:

We need to know the charge density distribution where we assume, for the ions in water I think, follow a Boltzmann distribution
