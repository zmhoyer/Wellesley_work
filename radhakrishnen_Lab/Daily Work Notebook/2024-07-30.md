Today I got in around 6:40 so I'll be leaving around 2.
- for today I'm gonna try and finish most of the tutorials as there shouldn't be too many left.


##### Computer cluster and intro to electrostatics
partial electronic charge/point charge model
- essentially as it's named, it's an approximation for each atom
	- This is done on the protein/small molecule scale
- The desolvation penalty is the biggest barrier to this method of charge optimization as the drug will bind too tightly to water if the charge is too intense

##### The continuum electrostatic model
coulomb's law - you want the total energy to be negative. With a lot of charge pairs you can essentially do a summation of many coulomb's law equations
- Still water is a problem and there are a couple ways to calculate this - water is really hard to model as they're always moving around, it's really polar and can form strong interactions, and there are sooooo many molecules of water
	- Explicitly where "every" water molecule is explicitly induced
		- You need to account for their motion/dynamics
	- Implicitly - do not model explicit water molecules - model instead their important interacitons
- The biggest thing we want to capture is the water's polarizability
- We will treat water as a bulk continuum "continuum electrostatics
	- We can essentially split a bulk block of water in a positive and negative charge end.
	- Essentially creating an electric field called a reaction field.
	- Water screens and or weakens electrostatic interaction between fixed charges
Linear response model - the reaction field strength/ polarization response is linearly proportional to inducing a charge
- If you have a sodium ion in water the water will orient themselves in a way to generate a reaction field in the value of -a
- if you take a calcium ion of +2 the reaction field should have a value of -2a![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 7.39.40 AM.png]]
- This is true to an extent, it will reach saturation at a certain point so we work in the linear portion of the relationship
- We can work out coulombs law and calculate the favorability
	- The equation works out to be a 2 squared reaction or 4 times more favorable to solvate calcium than sodium
	- Plus three ion would be 9 times greater
The interaction energy between two charges is coulombs law
	What if there is water between them
- We treat the water as a bulk polarizable continuum and this continuum has a dielectric constant.
	- Water has roughly a dielectric constant of 80, very high, very polarizable
		- Looking at a modified coulombs law, the interaction is decreased by a factor of the dielectric constant.
		- In the case of water it's screened by a factor of 80
So we know water's dielectric, but what about "biomolecules"
- So we model the interior of biomolecules also as a dielectric continuum
	-  The problem with this is that we are assigning a molecule with macroscopic properties
	- The dielectric of a protein is roughly 4 but it can vary from 2 -> 20 and the program we use can even use a variant dielectric
- When we have a spatially variant dielectric constant coulomb's law no longer holds![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 7.53.34 AM.png]]
- The fundamental equation of electrostatics: Poisson equation Around 43 minuets in
	- We use the laplacian, the second partial derivative in each rectangular direction, operating on phi function, the potential, which is equal to 4πρ (x,y,z)
- In the equation below we multiply the potential by the charge we get the free energy
- We know the charge distribution but we want the potential at each point in space
	- To do this we must find a function that satisfies these conditions at every point in space
- We don't really use the laplacian as the potential distribution is spacially variant
- If you were to solve the poisson equation of a point charge in a vacuum it turns out to be coulombs law
We actually solve the linearized poisson-Boltzmann equation as we can't solve the poisson exactly with just the poisson and this allows us to account for mobile ions in the solvent as well
- ![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 8.04.00 AM.png]]
- What does it mean to not be able to solve this exactly
	- The answer is the φ(x,y,z) is a numerical function
	- Not an analytical function
		- ex: f(x,y,z) = 5x<sup>2</sup> + 3yz
		- aka we know the exact function and can solve it easily
	- Everything we know is a numerical function
		- The temperature at all points in this room as a function of time
		- It's basically an infinite amount of information and so it cannot be easily represented
		- The only way we can represent equations like this is to get as much information as possible for as cheaply as possible
		- we lay down a grid and the system only exists at each node or intersection

##### Calculating dG_elec: the actual files and commands

Goal: the deltaG of the binding energy of the drug ponatinib and the AB1 kinase
- dG = LDP + RDP + INT 
- Binding free energy = ligand desolvation penalty + receptor desolvation penalty + complex interactions
	- Ligand desolvation penalty - going from a dielectric of 80 from water to roughly a dielectric of 4 when bound to the protein
	- Receptor desolvation penalty - going from a receptor site dielectric of 80 to the dielectric of the small molecule
	- complex interactions - this is if we look at the bound state and look at the charges to see if it's a favorable interaction
- dGelec is usually > 0 :(
- We will numerically solve the LPBE
	- To do this we will take the bound and unbound state and make the grid that we then converge
	- We then use the partial differential equation at each of those grid points and then we'll be solving for the potential to multiply by the charge to get the free energy

What we need to tell the computer:
 - We need a bound state
	 - What and where are the point charges - CRD
	 - Where is the dielectric boundary - radii_fixNH3.siz
 - An unbound state
	 - What and where are the point charges - CRD
	 - Where is the dielectric boundary - radii_fixNH3.siz
- What parameters do we need for our solver
	- param.file 
		- First crd is listed
		- Grid size defining the number of points on one size - so it's the defined number to the power of 3 to calculate number of points - has to odd and we'll specify from 65 to 401
		- focus = 23. 92. 184 - this is essentially saying that we will start with a big box with low resolution but accurate boundary conditions, go to a smaller box with higher resolution and use some calculated values from the first resolution to create good boundary conditions for the second and third image. ![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 9.04.21 AM.png]]
		- offset - for a differential equation of the grid the offset is to translate the grid to get a slightly different answer. This reduces error to translate, solve, average. (translation 1 = translation 2 = translation 3)
		- innerdie - inter dielectric - typically 4 for this lab
		- outerdiel - usually water
		- surface=delphi -  how it calculates the molecular surface to the dielectric boundary
		- salt=0.145M = salt conc
		- Stern=2 - this is essentially the same thing as radprb for salts
		- radprb = 1.4Å - water takes up space and can't fit in all little crevices. Since it can't fit everywhere this is an approximation of the molecular boundary shape by using this value as the radius for a ball rolling over the molecule
		- boundary = 4 - this is the boundary condition. We need this because during integration you get the +C term and thus don't know the answer unless you have some explicit solution to extrapolate from.
		- lit=a - this is the linear iteration type and a stands for automatic instead finite to reach convergence 
		- nlit = 0 - no non linear iterations is what this stands for
		- de = 1e-6 how different you want the sides of the equation to be before you call it day calculation wise
		- MAX_RAD =3.0 is the largest radius you have so it sets the grid properly
- Now we tell the computer what the bound and unbound states look like - run file
	- We will have 4 bound/unbound states where the charge times the potential will give the free energy
		- Charge optimized ligand molecule bound and unbound
			- Take the difference between the bound and unbound to get the ligand desolvation penalty - LDP 
			- Since the fictitious receptor molecule isn't allowed to interact, only desolvate, we then add in the receptor charge optimization to calculate the complex interaction energy
		- Charge optimized receptor bound and unbound
			- Take the difference between the bound and unbound to get the receptor desolvation penalty - RDP
			- Since the fictitious ligand molecule isn't allowed to interact, only desolvate, we then add in the ligand charge optimization to calculate the complex interaction energy
		- The complex interaction energy
			- I think this is taken by using the unbound receptor charge optimization with the bound ligand charge optimization potential and multiplying it by their charges
			- Vise versa this and then take the average?
	- For the Run file - first specify the two bound states
		- Drug
		- mark=final - bound state
		- name_group="bound_L" - the ligand is bound and charged
		- atoms_charged=( segid eq "D") - charge opt of only the drug
		- atoms_shape=all - all atoms contribute to the shape but only the dug is charged up
		- Atoms_center=(segid eq "D") - whos the star
		- 
		- Receptor
		- mark=final - bound state
		- name_group="bound_R" - the receptor is bound and charged
		- atoms_charged=( segid eq "A" || segid eq "B" || segid eq "C" || segid eq "E" || segid eq "W") - charge opt of only the receptor chains | | is a logical or (a conversational and)
		- atoms_shape=all - all atoms contribute to the shape but only the dug is charged up
		- Atoms_center=(segid eq "D") - who's the star
	- Than specify the unbound states
		- mark=reference -unbound state
		- name_group="unbound_L" - the ligand is bound and charged
		- atoms_charged=( segid eq "D") - charge opt of only the drug
		- atoms_shape=( segid eq "D") - only drug atoms contribute to the shape
		- Atoms_center=(segid eq "D") - whos the star
		- 
		- mark=reference - unbound state
		- name_group="unbound_R" - the ligand is bound and charged
		- atoms_charged=( segid eq "A" || segid eq "B" || segid eq "C" || segid eq "E" || segid eq "W") - charge opt of only the receptor
		- atoms_shape= ( segid eq "A" || segid eq "B" || segid eq "C" || segid eq "E" || segid eq "W") - only receptor atoms contribute to the shape
		- Atoms_center=(segid eq "D") - whos the star
	- Take the potentials from the bound state and the unbound state of the corresponding charge opt and then multiply it by that charge optimization to get that free energy. The charges come from
		- mark=output
		- atoms charged=(segid eq "D")
		- name="L"
		- mark=output
		- atoms charged=( segid eq "A" || segid eq "B" || segid eq "C" || segid eq "E" || segid eq "W")
		- name="R"

##### How the solver numerically solves a differential equation: the finite difference method
The finite difference method is essentially calculating out a derivative but instead of making the space between the points approach an infinitely small distance, we allow for an, albeit small, distance remain there for the approximation of the limit
- Furthering this method is when you take the second "derivative" aka you pick a point i and calculate the rate of change of the i-1 divided by the defined h minus i+1 divided by the defined h all over the value of h to get a sampling of points up and down stream of i![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 1.56.30 PM.png]]

- Although our matrices are too big to invert, the idea is still the same in solving this![[Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 2.05.52 PM.png]]
