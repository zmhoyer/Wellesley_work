# Daily items and list of what I did

Happy Friday maybe, I'm not sure, it just started.
- anyways, I've got a lot to do so I better get started on it yippee


## What I Learned? Techniques on how I did it

#### Constrained charge optimization

why do we need it?
- looking at a two dimensional charge dependent L-matrix surface![[Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.32.32 AM.png]]
- you have shallow dimensions when an atom has a small affect on the gibbs and steeper dimensions when there's an atom with a big affect
- This leads to the charge opt program to tell you to make a shallow dimensional atom something like charge 10 and this isn't possible to do.                         ![[Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.35.01 AM.png]]
- So can put some constraints on our charge magnitudes to make them be physically possible
	- constraint #1: for all charges (upside down A stands for all sub i) -1 < q<sub>i</sub> <1
	- constraint #2: the charge optimization for every wave-function must be an integer![[Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.40.13 AM.png]]

Optimization generally:
- an optimization problem has two parts
	- 1: the objective function - what you are tryin to optimize as a function of your variables
		- in our case it turns out to be (the RDP is the constant)![[Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.45.02 AM.png]]
	- 2: the constraints - define the feasible region (the search space over which you are optimizing)
	- Then you ask if you're goin to minimize or maximize and in our case we want to minimize
		- s.t. can stand for such that or subject to![[Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.48.27 AM.png]]
