# Daily items and list of what I did

I got that dawg in me today and by that I mean I do not have that dawg in me.
- I'm about done with the viz script but I accidentally messed up and tried to convert the crd to pdb myself
- I'm starting the MD simulations and should be done with that before stopping for the day
	- I'm also going to be using [[GROMACS force field]]GROMACS


## What I Learned? Techniques on how I did it


MD simulations
 - To get the starting velocities we use a random sample from a maxwell distribution of speeds for a given temperature. We then apply these to a position file and begin the simulation
 - After defining the position and the velocity we integrate newton's first law's of motion and use an algorithm
	 - Sample algorithm
	 - 1st: calculate the Emm of current system
	 - 2nd: calculate forces on each atom - taking the negative derivative of the potential energy gives you the force and can be related to the force felt on an individual atom. ![[Pasted image 20240820162122.png]]
	 - 3rd: calculate accelerations for each atom: Fx = max or ax = Fx/m
	 - Numerical integration time
		 - You must specify the timestep for the simulation
	 - 4th: update all velocities for all atoms
	 - 5th: update all position for all atoms![[Pasted image 20240820163321.png]]
- So what's the timestep?
	- We tend to focus on the fastest things we would want to see in molecular mechanics which are bond vibrations - these vibration's frequency matches the frequency of infrared which is why we study molecular vibrations at this frequency
	- these vibrations occur around 10<sup>13</sup> to 10<sup>14</sup> times a second so we need to set the timestep equal to around  10<sup>-15</sup> s or 1 femto-second
	- if you wanted a 1 millisecond trajectory you'd need 10<sup>12</sup> steps or a trillion steps
	- Take a lot of wall time
- For the water model in this lab we use an implicit water model for the continuum electrostatics portion of the lab
	- To do this two effects need to be modeled
		- Polar interactions
		- The hydrophobic effect
	- Often: model water as a dielectric medium -> bulk continuum
- component analysis
	- essentially it's the calculation of a difference. To be more specific, alanine mutagenesis(substitution) compared to the original would be a component analysis of the substituted amino acid
	- It can also be done on the charges of a residue to test it's importance to electrostatic binding affinity ![[Pasted image 20240820202623.png]]
