# Daily items and list of what I did




## What I Learned? Techniques on how I did it

-  How to visualize static charge optimization results
	- Blue it's too negative and you want to make it more positive
	- Red it's too positive and you want to make it more negative
	- White means something is close to optimal charge
	- Size is relevant to the atom's relative affect on the the molecules optimal binding free energy. It's the sensitivity of the binding free energy to a perturbation in the atoms charge
	- The color scale needs to be sematric in the sense that white is the middle and blue/red are equidistant extremes
	- How to do it?
		- make a vector called q<sub>diff</sub>
		- Make a new vector from the vector qL<sub>opt</sub> - qL<sub>act</sub>
			- This tells you whether you need to make it more negative or positive
		- or Make a new vector from the vector qL<sub>act</sub> - qL<sub>opt</sub>
			- This tells you whether you're too negative or positive
		- Now we need to make a pdb for use in vmd
			- There is a pdb to crd converter in the path /programs/common/utilities/crd2pdb arg arg
				- This pdb file needs to have the last column the difference of charges
				- Coloring method beta in the coloring tab will color by the last coulmn
				- she like cpk and coloring by the differences
				- we need to create two dummy atoms with the highest charges to create an equal scale at the end of the pdb
			- We also need to change the size of the atom to show it's affect on the optimal binding free energy
				- L<sub>11</sub> is essentially measuring the steepness of the N dimensional parabaloid in the q<sub>1</sub><sup>t</sup> q<sub>1</sub> direction
				- This measure of steepness is directly related to the affect of an atom on the binding free energy ![[Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 9.34.56 AM.png]]
				- This allows us to approximate the sensitivity of the binding free energy to each atoms charge as the diagonal desolvation element for that 
					- It's an approximation because it assumes that the other atoms are at their optimal charges when they aren't necessarily ![[Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 9.38.11 AM.png]]
				- Elements that tend to get desolvated a lot during binding tend to have higher values of L<sub>11</sub>  than atoms who tend to get desolvated.
					- So we need to extract the diagonal elements from the L matrix and use those values as input to VMD to tell VMD how to size them. We do this using the radii as the changing variable
				- We need to write a python script to write a VMD script 
					- To call in a VMD script you need to type play "" to actually run it
